Mini-project description
========================
"Stopwatch": The Game
---------------------

Our mini-project for this week will focus on combining text drawing in the canvas with timers to build a simple digital stopwatch that keeps track of the time in tenths of a second. The stopwatch should contain "Start", "Stop" , "Lap" and "Reset" buttons.
